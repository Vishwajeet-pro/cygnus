# Cygnus 🚀

Cygnus is a modern, 5-page responsive website for a fictional FinTech (financial technology) app. This project is built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

The design focuses on a sleek, **dark-mode** aesthetic, utilizing CSS variables, gradients, and "glassmorphism" for the navbar. It also features subtle reveal-on-scroll animations to create a professional and dynamic user experience.
